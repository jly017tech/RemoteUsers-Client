<h1>Windows Remote Connection in IT Homelab</h1>

<p>
  A Remote Connection in Windows allows users or administrators to access and control another Windows computer or server from a different location, as if they were sitting directly in front of it. This capability is essential for IT management, troubleshooting, remote work, and system administration in both enterprise and homelab environments.
